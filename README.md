# Linear Equation

### e. LU Factorization

**Overview:** LU factorization decomposes a square matrix \( A \) into a product of a lower triangular matrix \( L \) and an upper triangular matrix \( U \).

**Steps:**

1. Start with a square matrix \( A \).
2. Initialize \( L \) as an identity matrix and \( U \) as a copy of \( A \).
3. Perform Gaussian elimination to convert \( U \) to upper triangular form while updating \( L \) with multipliers.
4. The result is \( A = LU \), where \( L \) contains the multipliers and \( U \) is upper triangular.

**Applications:**

- Solving linear systems with the same coefficient matrix.
- Matrix inversion.
- Calculating determinants.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficient for multiple systems with the same matrix.**
- **Simplifies the solution process into triangular systems.**
- **More stable than some direct methods.**

**Disadvantages:**

- **Requires additional storage for \( L \) and \( U \).**
- **Can be unstable for singular or nearly singular matrices.**
- **Partial pivoting may be needed for better stability, complicating the process.**

# Nonlinear Equations

Nonlinear equations are equations where the relationship between variables is not linear. These equations include higher powers of variables (e.g., \(X^2\) or \(X^3\)), as well as trigonometric (e.g., sin(x), cos(x)), exponential, and logarithmic functions. In nonlinear equations, the dependent variable does not change in direct proportion to the independent variable.

For example, in the equation \(y = x^2 + 1\), as \(x\) increases, \(y\) changes in a non-linear manner. The highest degree (power) of any term in the equation is called the degree of the equation, and the total number of solutions corresponds to this degree.

## General Form of Nonlinear Equation

A common representation of a nonlinear equation of degree 3 is:

\[ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \]

where \(x\) and \(y\) are variables and \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are constants.

## Methods for Finding Roots of Nonlinear Equations

There are several numerical methods to find the roots of nonlinear equations. Some of the most common methods include:

### 1. Bisection Method

The Bisection Method, also known as the binary chopping or half-interval method, works under the condition that if a function \(f(x)\) is real and continuous within an interval \(a < x < b\) and \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) are opposite signs, that is \(f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0\), then there is at least one real root in the interval between \(a\) and \(b\).

1. Start with an interval \(temp_a, temp_b\) where \(temp_a = -Xmax\) & \(temp_b = -Xmax + 1\) if \(f(temp_a)\) and \(f(temp_b)\) have opposite signs. Then these values are taken as \(a = temp_a\) and \(b = temp_b\) and the first root is calculated by following steps 2 to 5.
2. Compute the midpoint \(x_0\) as:

   \[ X_0 = \frac{a + b}{2} \]

3. Check if \(f(X_0) = 0\). If yes, then \(X_0\) is the root.
4. If \(f(X_0) \cdot f(a) < 0\), replace \(b\) with \(X_0\) (narrowing the interval to \([a, x_0]\)).
5. If \(f(X_0) \cdot f(b) < 0\), replace \(a\) with \(X_0\) (narrowing the interval to \([X_0, b]\)).
6. Repeat this process until all roots are found. After finding the first root using step 1, calculate a new interval to find the remaining roots.

### 2. False Position Method

The False Position Method improves upon the Bisection Method by introducing a more efficient formula to find the root. Instead of using the midpoint, it calculates an improved estimate using the function values at the interval endpoints. Here \(a\) and \(b\) are calculated in the same way as in the bisection method for every root.

The formula is:

\[ X_0 = \frac{a \cdot f(b) - b \cdot f(a)}{f(b) - f(a)} \]

Steps are similar to the bisection method, but the formula for the root is recalculated using the above formula. This method tends to converge faster.

### 3. Newton-Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson Method is a more efficient and faster method that starts with an initial guess and iteratively improves it. This method uses the derivative of the function to find successively better approximations to the root.

The formula is:

\[ X_i = X_{i-1} - \frac{f(X_{i-1})}{f'(X_{i-1})} \]

Steps:

1. Start with an initial guess \(X_0\) where \(X_0 = \frac{a + b}{2}\).
2. Compute the next approximation using the formula.
3. Repeat until the function value \(f(X_i)\) is sufficiently close to zero.

### 4. Secant Method

The Secant Method is similar to the Newton-Raphson method but does not require the computation of the derivative. Instead, it approximates the derivative by using two previous points. The formula is:

\[ X_{n+1} = X_n - \frac{f(X_n) \cdot (X_n - X_{n-1})}{f(X_n) - f(X_{n-1})} \]

Steps:

1. Start with an initial guess \(X_n\) and \(X_{n-1}\) where \(X_n = a\) and \(X_{n-1} = b\).
2. Compute the next approximation using the formula.
3. Repeat until the function value \(f(X_{n+1})\) is sufficiently close to zero.

## Summary of Methods

|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Bisection Method  | Moderate   | Finds root by halving intervals         |

**Disadvantages:**

- **Fixed Step Size:** Standard RK4 can be inefficient for problems that need variable step sizes for better accuracy.
- **Computationally Intensive:** More calculations per step than simpler methods like Euler's method.

### Matrix Inversion

1. **LU Decomposition:** Decompose matrix \(A\) into \(A=LU\), where:
   - \(L\) is a lower triangular matrix with ones on its diagonal.
   - \(U\) is an upper triangular matrix.
   - This decomposition can be done using techniques like Gaussian elimination.
2. **Set up Identity Matrix:** To find the inverse, let \(I\) be the identity matrix.
3. **Solve for Inverse Columns:**
   - Solve to find matrix \(Y\) (intermediate matrix).
   - Solve to get the inverse.
   - These are solved by considering each column of \(I\) and finding the corresponding column in the inverse.
4. **Combine Solutions:** The columns from step 3 form the inverse matrix.

**Applications:**

- System of Linear Equations: Used for efficiently solving linear systems where multiple right-hand sides need to be solved.
- Engineering and Science: Common in numerical simulations and modeling where inversion of large matrices is required.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficient for Repeated Solutions:** LU decomposition can be reused for multiple right-hand sides, saving computation.
- **Simplifies Calculations:** Once \(L\) and \(U\) are computed, inverting becomes a set of straightforward linear solves.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Not Always Stable:** LU decomposition may be numerically unstable for certain matrices (e.g., singular or near-singular matrices).
